      <h1>The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (2001)</h1>
      <hr />
      <p>
        In the Second Age of Middle-earth, Sauron, the Dark Lord, forges the One
        Ring to dominate the other Rings of Power. A final alliance of Men and
        Elves defeats Sauron, but Isildur, corrupted by the Ring, takes it for
        himself. The Ring is lost for centuries until it falls into the hands of
        Bilbo Baggins, who passes it to his nephew Frodo. Gandalf discovers the
        Ring's true nature and warns Frodo to flee. Accompanied by friends,
        Frodo sets out to destroy the Ring in Mount Doom. Along the way, they
        face dangers, including attacks from Sauron's forces and betrayal from
        Saruman. Gandalf falls battling a Balrog, and the Fellowship is split.
        In Lothl√≥rien, Galadriel warns Frodo of the Ring's corrupting influence
        and shows him a vision of Sauron's victory. At Parth Galen, Boromir
        tries to take the Ring but repents before his death. Frodo decides to
        continue the journey alone, with Sam by his side, while Aragorn,
        Legolas, and Gimli set out to rescue Merry and Pippin.

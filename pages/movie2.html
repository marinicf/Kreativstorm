      <h1>The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (2002)</h1>
      <hr />
      <p>
        Frodo and Sam, accompanied by Gollum, journey towards Mordor, while
        Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli seek to rescue Merry and Pippin. They
        encounter Gandalf, now Gandalf the White, and together they help free
        King Théoden from Saruman's influence. Théoden prepares for battle
        against Saruman's forces at Helm's Deep, aided by Lothlorien Elves.
        Meanwhile, Merry and Pippin ally with Treebeard and the Ents, who attack
        Isengard, trapping Saruman. At Helm's Deep, the defenders face
        overwhelming odds but are saved by Gandalf and Éomer's arrival with the
        Rohirrim. Gollum leads Frodo and Sam towards Mordor but is captured by
        Rangers led by Faramir, who learns of the One Ring. Frodo convinces
        Faramir to release them, but Gollum's loyalty wavers as he plans to lead
        them into danger.

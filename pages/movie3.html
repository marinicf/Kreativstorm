      <h1>The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003)</h1>
      <hr />
      <p>
        In the depths of Middle-earth's history, the tragic tale of Sméagol, who
        becomes the twisted creature Gollum, unfolds with the discovery and
        murder over the One Ring. Centuries later, during the War of the Ring,
        Gandalf leads a coalition to Isengard, gathering allies and warning of
        Sauron's impending assault on Gondor. Meanwhile, Frodo, Sam, and Gollum
        journey towards Mount Doom, their friendship tested by the Ring's
        influence and Gollum's treachery. As Aragorn rallies forces for Gondor,
        he embraces his destiny as its rightful king, aided by the oath-bound
        spirits. In the ensuing battle, Théoden falls, but Éowyn and Merry slay
        the Witch-king, turning the tide. Aragorn's diversion allows Frodo to
        reach Mount Doom, where he succumbs to the Ring's power, only to be
        saved by Gollum's final act. With Sauron defeated, Aragorn is crowned
        king, Frodo finds peace in the Undying Lands, and Sam returns home to a
        new chapter of happiness.
